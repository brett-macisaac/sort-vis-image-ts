# Description

A web app that visualises common sorting algorithms using an image. 

Key Features:

- A UI that adapts well to most screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- Works when the device is offline.
- Controls for pausing the sorting process and stepping forwards or backwards, which is useful for learning how these algorithms work.
- Any image can be uploaded to replace the default one.
- The speed of the sorting process can be adjusted.

The most interesting visualisations occur when you attempt to sort an already sorted image in the opposite direction, as in the example below.

# Where To Access

This project has been deployed on the [web](https://www.sort-viz-img.com/) and can be run on any device with a modern web browser. 

# Note for iOS Users

With iOS devices, the slider component doesn't work as expected: you can still click it, but you can't use a 'drag' gesture as one would expect from a slider.
